1   A 2nd-declension neuter has the same forms as the regular 2nd-declension masculine except in
    three instances. Name these three instances and give their neuter endings.

    Nom. sg. in -um; nom. and acc. pl. in -a. Actually the vocative should also be added here; but
    henceforth, since aside from the singular of 2nd-declension masuclines in -us the vocatives
    follow the rule of having the same form as the nominative, little specific mention is made
    of the vocative.

2   Name the case(s), number, and syntactical usage indicated by each of the following endings
    of the 2nd-declension neuter nouns:

    (1) -a  = nom. pl. as subject; acc. pl. as obj.

    (2) -um = nom. sg. as subj.; acc. sg. as obj.

3   Name the case(s) and number of the following 2nd-declension neuter endings and name the English
    preposition(s) which can be associated with each:

    (1) -ō    = dat. sg., to / for; abl. sg., by / with, etc.

    (2) -ōrum = gen. pl., of

    (3) -ī    = gen. sg., of

    (4) -īs   = dat. pl., to / for; abl. pl., by / with, etc.

4   Translate the following neuter nous and state the syntactical usage of each as indicated by its ending

    (3) officium = duty, subj. or obj.
