1   Give the Latin translation for the definite artile "the" and the indefinite article "a"

    In classical Latin there was no regular definite or indefinite article. The words "the" and "a" have to be
    added in the English translation according to the sense of a Latin passage. Thus puella may mean "the girl"
    or "a girl" and puellae may mean "the girls" or "girls" according to the Latin context. Often in an
    isolated sentence "the" and "a" can be used interchangeably, or perhaps no article at all need be used.
